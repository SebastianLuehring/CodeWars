// Twice As Old

// Your function takes two arguments:
// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).



function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
    return Math.abs(dadYearsOld - 2 * sonYearsOld);
  }
  
  
//   The Math.abs() function returns the absolute value of a number. That is, it returns x if x is positive or zero, and the negation of x if x is negative.

//   It is returning the absolute value of the son's age times 2 (2x) - the age of the father.
